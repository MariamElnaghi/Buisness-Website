        Weight changes in cats are always concerning,2ï»¿ whether it's gain or loss. <br>
		Either might be a sign of an underlying health problem. Weight loss is <br>
		more urgent in the short term whereas weight gain is usually more harmful over time.<br>
		If you are not sure about your cat's weight, make a vet appointment for a <br>
		check-up or at least a weight check.
         </li>
		 
		 <li>	  
         Check their litter box (Check how much times they
